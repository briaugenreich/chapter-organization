# Welcome to Women Who Code Richmond!

>Women Who Code (WWCode) is a global non-profit organization which inspires women to excel in careers in technology. We believe that innovation is driven by diversity and that the tech industry will be even better once women are no longer underrepresented. Women Who Code was founded in 2011 and has since grown to 100,000 members spanning 60 cities. The organization is best known for its technical study groups, hack nights, career development, and speaking events featuring influential technology industry experts and investors. Since inception, WWCode has produces more than 1,500 events worldwide each year and garnered sponsorship from organizations like KPCB, Paypal, Etsy, Heroku, Yelp, and many others.
