# Leadership Overview & Expectations 

TODO : Some intro about being volunteer led. Can particapte without being a lead (help a group not commit past that). 
Help with one event but not mroe. Outlines the expectations of the leads and your responsibilities.  

### Expectation of all Leads 

**Work toward the 2018 Netowrk goals**

- At the end of each year we will come together as a team to recap and plan for the following year. In this we will identify new or recurring [Goals](network-goals.md) for our network

**The most important requirement for our leadership team is that they are active members of the RVA Women Who Code Network.**

- Attend at least 2 meetups a month. You should be visible and engage. This doesnâ€™t mean you have to LEAD but you should be particpating. (going to tons of leadership meetings doesn't count!) 
- Be active on slack. 
    1. Welcome new members (the leads who attended a Meetup should each reach out to two newer attendees to follow up about something
                            leads who didn't attend the Meetup should monitor Slack to welcome new members in the channel by @name)                          
    2. encourage conversations in the general group 
    3. provide technical community through slack (post in your repsective technology domain channels )
    
    **slack is as active as we make it**
- Attend one quartely lead meeting with directors 

**Be open and committed**
- When life hits the fan just let us know you need to step back. This is why we have multiple people filling roles, But remember your commitments to your positions 
- Update github with resources & links posted in relevant channels for your events
- Coordinate with your leads on a regular basis (consider making a private slack channel to collaborate. for ex: all python leads would join #python-leads)
- Lean in! (something about helping other areas, coming up with ideas, and invtiting others to join)
- If you need help making an event, speak to one of the other leads or ask in #core-team on Slack.
