# Leadership Overview & Expectations 

Women Who Code is not possible without the wonderful volunteers who dedicate their time and passion to spreading our mission. Our networks are led by 400+ volunteers including our amazing team of ladies in Richmond. We need all forms of support! Those interested in hosting and sponsoring, presenting, coordinating one event or many. If youre interested in helping us **please do not hesitate to reach out** Below are our expectations of those interested in becoming a core team member. 

### Expectation of all Leads 

---

**Work toward the 2018 Network goals**

- At the end of each year we will come together as a team to recap and plan for the following year. In this we will identify new or recurring [Goals](network-goals.md) for our network

**The most important requirement for our leadership team is that they are active members of the RVA Women Who Code Network.**

- If you are not leading an event attend at least 2 meetups a month. You should be visible and engaged. This doesnâ€™t mean you have to LEAD but you should be particpating (if you do lead an event you are only requried to attend your event). 
- Be active on slack. 
    1. Welcome new members (the leads who attended a Meetup should each reach out to two newer attendees to follow up about something
                            leads who didn't attend the Meetup should monitor Slack to welcome new members in the channel by @name)                          
    2. encourage conversations in the general group 
    3. provide technical community through slack (post in your respective technology domain channels)
    
    **slack is as active as we make it**
- Attend one quarterly chapter meeting with other leads and directors 

**Be open and committed**
- When life hits the fan just let us know you need to step back. This is why we have multiple people filling roles, But remember your commitments to your positions 
- Update GitHub with resources & links posted in relevant channels for your events
- Coordinate with your leads on a regular basis (consider making a private slack channel to collaborate. For ex: all python leads would join #python-leads)
- Lean in! Invite friends and co-workers to join! Help come up with ideas for the future of WWC RVA. Jump onboard with other areas that might need help one month.
- If you need help making an event, speak to one of the other leads or ask in #core-team on Slack.

**Be a wwcode example**
- Uphold our [Code of Conduct](../code_of_conduct.md)
