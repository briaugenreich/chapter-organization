### Expectation of all Leads

**Work toward the 2018 Netowrk goals**

**The most important requirement for our leadership team is that they are active members of the RVA Women Who Code Network.**

- Attend at least 2 meetups a month. You should be visible and engage. This doesnâ€™t mean you have to LEAD but you should be particpating (if you do lead an event that counts toward your meetup count). 
- Be active on slack. 
    1. Welcome new members (the leads who attended a Meetup should each reach out to two newer attendees to follow up about something
                            leads who didn't attend the Meetup should monitor Slack to welcome new members in the channel by @name)                          
    2. encourage conversations in the general group 
    3. provide technical community through slack (post in your repsective technology domain channels )
    
    **slack is as active as we make it**
- Attend one quartely chapter meeting with other leads and directors 

**Be open and committed**
- When life hits the fan just let us know you need to step back. This is why we have multiple people filling roles, But remember your commitments to your positions 
- Update github with resources & links posted in relevant channels for your events
- Coordinate with your leads on a regular basis (consider making a private slack channel to collaborate. for ex: all python leads would join #python-leads)
- Lean in! (something about helping other areas, coming up with ideas, and invtiting others to join)
- If you need help making an event, speak to one of the other leads or ask in #core-team on Slack.
